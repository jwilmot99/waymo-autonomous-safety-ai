# Waymo — Autonomous Safety & Perception Optimization

## Role
AI Product Manager

## Problem
Autonomous vehicle perception systems must balance accuracy, latency, and safety. Small model changes can introduce regulatory and real-world risk.

## Users & Stakeholders
- Safety Operations
- ML Engineering
- Policy & Compliance

## Product Goals & Metrics
- Object detection precision / recall
- False-negative safety events
- End-to-end latency
- Intervention rate

## Solution
Defined product requirements and success metrics for perception improvements. Created user stories and a phased deployment roadmap to validate safety before full rollout.

## Key Tradeoffs
- Accuracy vs latency
- Model complexity vs interpretability
- Validation speed vs regulatory risk

## Outcome
Delivered a metrics-driven roadmap for safely shipping perception improvements.
